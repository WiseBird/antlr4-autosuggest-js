JavaScript autosuggest engine for ANTLR4 grammars
=================================================
Oran Epelbaum

To get started, have a look at the unit tests.

Getting the antlr-autosuggest JavaScript Module
-----------------------------------------------
```bash
npm install --save antlr4-autosuggest
```

Examples
--------

A - Generating suggestions for a generated grammar

```javascript
const autosuggest = require('autosuggest');

// Load parser and lexer classes generated by antlr4
const myLexer = require('./myLexer.js');
const myParser = require('./myParser.js');

// Suggest completions for the string "ABC"
const factory = new autosuggest.GrammarFactory(myLexer.myLexer, myParser.myParser);
var suggester = new autosuggest.AutoSuggester(factory, "ABC");
var suggestions = suggester.suggest();
```

How It Works
------------
See explanation in the [Java project](https://github.com/oranoran/antlr4-autosuggest/).

Building
--------
* Clone the antlr-autosuggest-js repository.
* Install Node and NPM (tested with 8)
* Run the command `npm test`.
